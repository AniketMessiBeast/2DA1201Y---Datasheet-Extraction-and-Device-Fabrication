## Project Overview
This project involves the study and implementation of the 2DA1201Y PNP BJT device provided by Diodes Incorporated. The project is divided into two distinct stages that cover both theoretical and practical aspects of device analysis and fabrication.

### Stage 1: Datasheet Extraction and Circuit Design
- **Objective**: 
   - Extract key parameters from the 2DA1201Y PNP BJT datasheet, such as current gain, saturation voltages, breakdown voltages, and power dissipation.
   - Develop a physical structure with appropriate dimensions and doping profile based on the extracted parameters.
   - Propose a simple circuit using the 2DA1201Y PNP BJT device, focusing on biasing the device at optimal bias points.

- **Tasks**:
  1. Analyze the datasheet for relevant device parameters.
  2. Design a BJT structure based on the parameters, defining appropriate doping concentrations and physical dimensions.
  3. Design a simple circuit using the PNP BJT and calculate the biasing points.

### Stage 2: Fabrication Methodology and Detailed Analysis
- **Objective**: 
   - Finalize the parameters and the circuit design from Stage 1.
   - Submit a comprehensive analysis along with a detailed fabrication methodology for the proposed circuit.

- **Tasks**:
  1. Finalize the device parameters and circuit design.
  2. Provide a detailed step-by-step procedure for the fabrication of the circuit, including material selection, lithography process, doping techniques, and contact formation.
