## Project Overview
This project involves the study and implementation of the 2DA1201Y PNP BJT device provided by Diodes Incorporated. The project is divided into two distinct stages that cover both theoretical and practical aspects of device analysis and fabrication.

### Stage 1: Datasheet Extraction and Circuit Design
  1. Analyze the datasheet for relevant device parameters.
  2. Design a BJT structure based on the parameters, defining appropriate doping concentrations and physical dimensions.
  3. Design a simple circuit using the PNP BJT and calculate the biasing points.

### Stage 2: Fabrication Methodology and Detailed Analysis
  1. Provide a detailed step-by-step procedure for the fabrication of the circuit, including material selection, lithography process, doping techniques, and contact formation.
  2. Perform a detailed analysis of the circuit's performance metrics, including current, voltage characteristics, and power dissipation.

## Deliverables
1. Parameter extraction report from the 2DA1201Y datasheet.
2. Circuit design with biasing points and doping profile.
3. Detailed fabrication methodology document for the final circuit.
4. Performance analysis report of the fabricated circuit.
